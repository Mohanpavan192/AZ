Mostly used in questions involving subarrays and substrings, where individual contribution matters
find minimum or maximum or distinct elements of all subarrays/substrings of a given array
instead of asking how many elements present ina  subarray, we have to ask, how many subarrays does thsi element contribute
Questions
IMPortant
When duplicate elements are involved, consider only first occurrence on either left side or right side,
like in thsi problem, find sum of minimum of all subarrays,when duplicate elements are present
